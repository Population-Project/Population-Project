## Article 1:
The research introduces a Dual-Stream Network (DSN) for population forecasting that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to simultaneously extract spatiotemporal features from historical data. These features are fused into a comprehensive vector, which is then refined using a Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) to reduce redundancy and prevent overfitting. Experimental results show that this approach enhances the model's ability to capture discriminative patterns and improve the accuracy of population projections

## Article 2:
A dual-stream network for population projection is proposed, integrating 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and an Additive Attention Mechanism (Dual CSA). The Dual CSA extracts spatiotemporal features in parallel from historical data, with the 1D-CNN and BiLSTM processing the data simultaneously. The attention mechanism is applied to select important features from the BiLSTM output, which are then concatenated with the CNN output to form a comprehensive feature vector. Extensive experiments are conducted to identify the optimal model for accurate population forecasting
